# Harness MVP Contract v1

- Status: Proposed
- Contract version: `1.0.0`
- Scope: minimal Harness registry and the existing Text2Env Stage 0-5 route
- Authority: this contract defines the Harness-facing interface; existing `scene_gen` schemas,
  package manifests, and validation reports remain authoritative for their own payloads.
- Implementation evidence: [PR1 core-schema report](HARNESS_MVP_PR1_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.zh-CN.md)

## Decision And Boundary

The in-process `SkillRegistry` is the only execution, type, version, and audit authority. MCP is
a stateless protocol adapter generated from registered descriptors. It must not own business
types, select versions, retry calls, alter results, or decide publication.

This contract covers only Text2Env compilation, RoboTwin/SAPIEN replay, and validation. It does
not define Anchor2Env, network asset search, a second simulator, Transfer, plugin hot loading,
distributed scheduling, policy execution, data collection, training, or evaluation.

## Skill Identity And Versioning

A Skill identity is the tuple `(skill_id, version)`. Its canonical display form is
`<skill_id>@<version>`. `skill_id` must match
`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,31}\.[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,31}$`. Registered versions use stable SemVer
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with no leading zeroes, prerelease suffix, or build suffix. Every invocation
must name an exact version; ranges, implicit `latest`, and silent fallback are forbidden.

| Canonical Skill ref | MCP tool name | Input schema | Output schema |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text2env.compile@1.0.0` | `text2env_compile_v1_0_0` | `harness.text2env_compile_input.v1` | `harness.text2env_compile_output.v1` |
| `text2env.replay@1.0.0` | `text2env_replay_v1_0_0` | `harness.text2env_replay_input.v1` | `harness.text2env_replay_output.v1` |
| `text2env.validate@1.0.0` | `text2env_validate_v1_0_0` | `harness.text2env_validate_input.v1` | `harness.text2env_validate_output.v1` |

The MCP name is mechanically derived by replacing `.` in `skill_id` with `_`, prefixing the
version with `_v`, and replacing version dots with `_`. The canonical Skill ref remains the
identity stored in all records.

Version changes follow these rules:

- `MAJOR`: remove or rename a field; add a required field or any output field; narrow valid input;
  change defaults, state/error meaning, determinism, or a publication gate.
- `MINOR`: add an optional input with an unchanged default, widen accepted input, add an artifact
  inside an existing artifact collection, or add a fail-closed error code without changing
  existing outcomes.
- `PATCH`: fix an implementation defect without changing public schemas or declared semantics.

Skill SemVer is independent of the Python package version, `robotwin.*.v1` schema identifiers,
package-manifest version, and `compiler_version`; every one is recorded separately. A registered
`(skill_id, version)` is immutable. Re-registering it with a different descriptor or
implementation digest must fail with `HARN_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`. Every public JSON-schema shape
change receives a new integer schema identifier; a breaking shape change also requires a Skill
major version. Consumers must preserve unknown blocker codes and fail closed, which makes an
additive code a minor change.

## Common Records

All common records are strict: unknown fields are rejected, required unknown values are never
guessed, and JSON uses UTF-8 with sorted keys and compact separators for canonical hashing.

| Record | Required fields |
| --- | --- |
| `SkillDescriptor` (`harness.skill_descriptor.v1`) | `skill_id`, `version`, `mcp_tool_name`, `input_schema`, `output_schema`, `implementation_name`, `implementation_version`, `implementation_sha256`, `deterministic=true`, `max_attempts`, `qualification_artifact` |
| `SkillDescriptorV2` (`harness.skill_descriptor.v2`) | the same identity, implementation, schema, attempt, and qualification fields, with `reproducibility` replacing `deterministic` |
| `Invocation` (`harness.skill_invocation.v1`) | `run_id`, `skill_id`, `skill_version`, `effective_parameters`, `dependencies`, `max_attempts`, `invocation_digest` |
| `RunState` (`harness.run_state.v1`) | `run_id`, `invocation_digest`, `skill_id`, `skill_version`, `status`, `attempt`, `max_attempts`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `events`, `artifacts`, `output`, `blocker` |
| `Event` (`harness.event.v1`) | `seq`, `timestamp`, `stage`, `attempt`, `from_status`, `to_status`, `artifact_refs` |
| `ArtifactRef` (`harness.artifact_ref.v1`) | `name`, `uri`, `media_type`, `sha256`, `bytes`, `schema_version` |
| `Blocker` (`harness.blocker.v1`) | `code`, `message`, `stage`, `retryable`, `details`, `unknowns`, `artifact_refs` |

`run_id` is an audit identifier and is not a content identity. `ArtifactRef.uri` is a locator and
is not trusted for identity; consumers verify `sha256`. `schema_version` is a string for typed
artifacts and `null` for untyped media. `unknowns` contains records with exactly `field`, `reason`,
and `source`.

Nullable fields remain present: `ended_at=null` while running; `Event.from_status=null` on the
first event; `invocation_digest=null` for a preflight skill/version/input/dependency blocker;
`output=null` until a typed output exists; and `RunState.blocker=null` unless the run is blocked or
failed. An `Invocation` record is created only after preflight has resolved the exact descriptor,
effective parameters, and dependencies. `qualification_artifact.schema_version` must be
`harness.skill_qualification.v1`; its payload contains exactly `skill_ref`, `status="pass"`,
`deterministic_case_id`, `regression_command`, and `report_sha256`.

Descriptor v1 is frozen and remains readable exactly as published: it accepts only
`deterministic=true`, rejects `reproducibility`, and is never silently converted to v2. Descriptor
v2 rejects the legacy `deterministic` field and requires exactly one `reproducibility` value:

- `content_bitwise_deterministic`: with the same typed input and exact dependency identities,
  typed output and artifact content are byte-identical. Compile continues to make this claim
  through its v1 `deterministic=true` descriptor.
- `evidence_invariant_repeatable`: physical, media, timing, and resource bytes may vary, but the
  fixed qualification case must re-satisfy every named evidence invariant. Replay makes this
  claim and does not claim byte-identical execution.

Both descriptor versions continue to point to `harness.skill_qualification.v1`. The legacy field
name `deterministic_case_id` identifies the fixed qualification case; for a v2
`evidence_invariant_repeatable` descriptor it does not imply byte identity. Registry
`register`, `list`, and `resolve` preserve the exact descriptor model and never rewrite one
version as the other.

`dependencies` is sorted by `name`; each entry contains exactly `name`, `version`, and `sha256`.
Defaults are expanded before hashing. `invocation_digest` is:

```text
sha256(canonical_json({
  "skill_id": skill_id,
  "skill_version": skill_version,
  "effective_parameters": parameters_with_artifact_uris_replaced_by_content_identity,
  "dependencies": dependencies_sorted_by_name,
  "max_attempts": max_attempts
}))
```

An artifact's content identity is exactly `media_type`, `schema_version`, and `sha256`. The digest
excludes `run_id`, timestamps, event data, artifact locations, and output directories. The request
text is hashed exactly as received; the Harness performs no linguistic normalization.

`max_attempts` is fixed in each descriptor: compile is 1, replay is 2, and validate is 1. Only a
result whose blocker has `retryable=true` may start another attempt under the same `run_id` and
`invocation_digest`. Every attempt emits events. Callers and MCP cannot change this policy.

## Text2Env Skill Contracts

| Skill | Required input | Required output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text2env.compile@1.0.0` | `request`, `seed`, `asset_catalog: ArtifactRef`, `config.generate_missing_assets` | `scene_spec: ArtifactRef`, `resolved_scene: ArtifactRef`, `environment_package: EnvironmentPackage`, `static_validation: ArtifactRef` |
| `text2env.replay@1.0.0` | `environment_package`, `runtime_config` | `runtime_evidence: ArtifactRef`, `replay_artifacts: tuple[ArtifactRef, ...]` |
| `text2env.validate@1.0.0` | `environment_package`, `runtime_evidence`, `gate_profile="robotwin.scene_validation.v1"` | `validation_report: ArtifactRef`, `validation_status`, `publishable`, `blockers: tuple[Blocker, ...]` |

`seed` is an integer from 0 through 2,147,483,647. The compile request may contain semantic intent
only; paths, asset identifiers, positions, and quaternions remain forbidden by `SceneSpec`.
Trusted asset locations are resolved from `ArtifactRef` and dependency records, never from request
text. Compile `config` contains exactly `generate_missing_assets: bool`, defaulting to `false`.
Replay `runtime_config` contains exactly `precheck_steps`, `settle_steps`,
`contact_window_steps`, `video_frames`, and `fps`, with effective defaults 0, 900, 120, 120, and
12 respectively; all effective values participate in `invocation_digest`.

`EnvironmentPackage` (`harness.environment_package.v1`) is an immutable reference to the existing
hash-bound package, not a duplicate package format. It contains exactly `package_id`,
`route_id="text2env"`, `producer_skill_ref`, `seed`, `scene_spec_sha256`,
`resolved_scene_sha256`, `asset_catalog: ArtifactRef`, and `package_manifest: ArtifactRef`.
`package_id` equals `resolved_scene_sha256`, and `asset_catalog.sha256` must equal the catalog
digest stored in both the resolved scene and package manifest.

Compilation invokes the existing parse, grounding, bounded solve, builder, and static validator
behavior. Its run is `succeeded` when typed compile outputs were produced, even though the static
validation status is normally `incomplete` because runtime evidence is absent. Replay produces
sequential physical evidence. Validate verifies the package, hash binding, runtime evidence, and
all gates; it is the only one of these three Skills that emits `publishable`.

## State, Errors, And Publication

`RunState.status` is one of `running`, `succeeded`, `blocked`, or `failed`. The only transitions
are `null -> running -> succeeded|blocked|failed`. A retry keeps the state `running`, increments
`attempt`, and appends events. `blocked` is an expected domain, dependency, or gate refusal;
`failed` is an unexpected Harness or implementation fault. Both terminal states require a
`RunState.blocker`; `succeeded` requires `RunState.blocker=null`. A successful Skill execution is
not by itself a validation pass. In particular, validate is `succeeded` when it produces a typed
`fail` or `incomplete` report; the output `blockers` explain why publication is refused.

Existing validation status remains `pass`, `incomplete`, or `fail`; no parallel gate-status enum
is introduced. `publishable=true` if and only if all of the following hold:

1. The compile, replay, and validate runs succeeded at the exact registered versions.
2. `verify_package` passed and every referenced artifact digest matched.
3. Runtime evidence is bound to the package's `resolved_scene_sha256`.
4. The final validation status is `pass` for physical, collision, stability, visibility, and video
   checks.
5. The registered Skill descriptors have passing qualification artifacts for their declared
   content-deterministic or evidence-invariant repeatability checks and regression tests.
6. Request provenance, versions, seed, dependency digests, and solver trace are present.

Any false condition yields `publishable=false` and at least one structured blocker in either the
validate output or, when no typed output could be produced, `RunState.blocker`. This contract
defines eligibility only; it does not define a `published` state or an external publication side
effect.

| Error code | Meaning | Default location | Default retryable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HARN_SKILL_NOT_FOUND` | No descriptor for the requested `skill_id` | run blocker: `blocked` | `false` |
| `HARN_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` | Exact version absent, conflicting, or mutated | run blocker: `blocked` | `false` |
| `HARN_INPUT_INVALID` | Invocation or Skill input failed strict schema validation | run blocker: `blocked` | `false` |
| `HARN_DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE` | Required dependency identity, version, or digest is unavailable | run blocker: `blocked` | `false` |
| `T2E_REQUEST_REJECTED` | Request failed the bounded prompt or `SceneSpec` boundary | run blocker: `blocked` | `false` |
| `T2E_ASSET_UNAVAILABLE` | Catalog or generated asset cannot satisfy grounding requirements | run blocker: `blocked` | `false` |
| `T2E_SOLVER_EXHAUSTED` | Bounded solver ended without a valid resolved scene | run blocker: `blocked` | `false` |
| `T2E_PACKAGE_INVALID` | Package construction, manifest, schema, or hash binding failed | run or validate-output blocker | `false` |
| `T2E_REPLAY_FAILED` | RoboTwin/SAPIEN replay did not produce complete evidence | run blocker: `blocked` | `true` |
| `T2E_VALIDATION_INCOMPLETE` | Required runtime checks were not run | validate-output blocker | `false` |
| `T2E_VALIDATION_FAILED` | One or more required validation checks failed | validate-output blocker | `false` |
| `T2E_REGRESSION_FAILED` | Registered qualification or declared reproducibility regression did not pass | registration blocker | `false` |
| `HARN_INTERNAL` | Unexpected Registry, adapter, or handler defect | run blocker: `failed` | `false` |

Exception text is diagnostic detail, never an error code. Existing `SceneSpecError`, pydantic
validation errors, `SceneSolveError` reports, package verification, replay exit status, and
validation reports map to the table by stage and recovery action.

## Registry And MCP

The MVP Registry is statically assembled at process start. It provides `register(descriptor,
handler)`, `list()`, `resolve(skill_id, exact_version)`, and `invoke(skill_id, exact_version,
parameters)`. Registration
rejects an invalid descriptor, a conflicting immutable identity, or a non-passing qualification
artifact. Invocation validates and expands inputs, computes the invocation digest, enforces the
descriptor's attempt bound, resolves dependency records, creates the `Invocation`, calls the
handler, hashes artifacts, and appends state events. Registry code must not contain Text2Env
branching; the three handlers adapt the existing Text2Env functions and CLIs.

MCP `tools/list` is generated mechanically from the registered descriptors and exposes the three
versioned tool names above. MCP `tools/call` resolves that name to the exact canonical Skill ref,
passes the Skill-specific JSON parameters to `Registry.invoke`, and returns the same typed output,
`RunState`, artifacts, and blocker as an in-process call. Malformed JSON-RPC remains an MCP
transport error; after a registered tool call enters the Registry, all outcomes use this contract.
Parameter defaults, dependency resolution, and run metadata are added only by the Registry. MCP
adds no defaults or protocol-only business fields.

## Acceptance

This contract is accepted when the project owner confirms the exact fields, names, state
transitions, error codes, version rules, and MCP mapping; all repository tests pass; and the RFC
header records `Status: Accepted`, the approver, and the approval date. Implementing the contract
must preserve the current Text2Env behavior and the existing hash-bound and physical-validation
acceptance rules.
